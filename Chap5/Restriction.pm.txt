Restriction
    Restriction: Given a Rebase object, sequence, and list of restriction
    enzyme names, return the locations of the recognition sites in the
    sequence

Synopsis
            use Restriction;

            use Rebase;

            use strict;
            use warnings;

            my $rebase = Rebase->new(
                    dbmfile => 'BIONET',
            bionetfile => 'bionet.212'
            );

            my $restrict = Restriction->new(
                    rebase => $rebase,
            enzyme => 'EcoRI, HindIII',
            sequence => 'ACGAATTCCGGAATTCG',
            );

            print "Locations for EcoRI are ", join(' ', $restrict->get_enzyme_map('EcoRI')), "\n";
